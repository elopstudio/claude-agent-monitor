# claude-agent-monitor

A local dashboard for every Claude Code session running on this machine, grouped as
**project → leader → agents**. No dependencies (Node 18+), read-only, listens on `127.0.0.1` only.

```bash
npm start            # http://127.0.0.1:4777  (override with PORT=…)
```

The page is in English by default. Switch to Korean with the **EN / 한국어** toggle in the header
(remembered in the browser) or open `http://127.0.0.1:4777/?lang=ko`.

## What you see

- **One tab per project.** Each tab shows the leader's robot and how many sessions are working (▶) or waiting (○).
  The selected tab is kept in the URL (`#project-name`) and in the browser.
- **Org chart.** The leader (crowned robot) sits on top; the other agents hang below it.
  Each card shows the session's current action in a speech bubble, how long it has been in its state, and its uptime.
- **Names.** Every agent also gets a person's name — Tom, Mark, … in English, 민준, 서연, … in Korean — so
  `-7f` and `-74` are easy to tell apart. The name is derived from the session id, so it is the same in every
  browser and on every poll, and no two agents in one project share one. Pin a name with `names` in `config.json`.
- **Board** (optional). The project's tasks in progress, queued (numbered), done, and decisions waiting on a human.
- **Team chat.** Who messaged whom, as one-line summaries.

The page polls every 3 seconds (every 15 seconds while the tab is hidden).

## What it reads

| Source | Used for |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` | Session name, working directory, busy/idle, start time. Entries whose process is gone are dropped |
| `~/.claude/projects/*/<sessionId>.jsonl` | **Only the last 768 KB** — the latest tool action and the summary line of messages sent to other sessions |
| `boards/<project>.json` | The task board and per-session roles, written by the project's leader — optional |
| `config.json` | Project labels, leader assignment, tab order — optional (see `config.example.json`) |

A project is the folder name of the git root above a session's working directory. The leader is the session
named in `config.json`; without one, it is the session that sent the most messages (at least 3).

## What it never reads, and what it shows

- `~/.claude/sessions/*.key`, `.credentials.json` and settings files are never opened.
- The cards, tabs, board and state API carry no user prompts, conversation text, tool results or message bodies:
  a tool action is reduced to its kind plus a short label (a file name or the command's own description), and
  web lookups show neither the URL nor the query. Socket addresses never reach the page.
- The one exception is the **conversation view** in an agent's detail dialog, which follows that session's
  transcript live, like the VS Code panel. It is streamed only while the dialog is open, needs the page's token,
  is never stored or logged, and is masked on the way out: e-mail addresses, phone numbers, resident registration
  and card numbers, and anything that looks like a key, token or password become `[email]`, `[secret]` and so on.
  Long letter-and-digit runs (a full commit hash, say) are masked too.
- Requests whose `Host` is not `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `[::1]` are refused (421), so a web page cannot
  reach the API by pointing its own domain at this machine (DNS rebinding).

## States

| Shown as | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ▶ Working | The session is busy — the robot is typing |
| ○ Waiting | Idle for less than 30 minutes — the robot is dozing |
| – Resting | Idle for 30 minutes or more — the robot is greyed out |

State is never carried by colour alone: every state also has a symbol, a word, a face and a motion.

## Approvals from the page (optional)

Permission prompts can be answered from the monitor instead of VS Code. Claude Code runs `hooks/bridge.mjs`
on every `PermissionRequest`; the request shows up at the top of the page, naming the agent that asked:

- **Tool prompts** — Allow, "Always allow: …" (the same choices VS Code offers), Deny, Deny and stop.
- **Questions** (`AskUserQuestion`) — pick the options or type your own answer, then send.
- **Plans** (`ExitPlanMode`) — Approve plan or Keep planning.
- **Answer in VS Code** hands any of them back to the normal prompt.
The same hook, on `PostToolUse` and `Stop`, tells the page each session's permission mode (MANUAL, AUTO, …).

Add this to `~/.claude/settings.json` (merge with any `hooks` you already have):

```json
"hooks": {
  "PermissionRequest": [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node \"C:/dev/claude-agent-monitor/hooks/bridge.mjs\"", "timeout": 90 }] }],
  "PostToolUse": [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node \"C:/dev/claude-agent-monitor/hooks/bridge.mjs\"", "async": true, "timeout": 10 }] }],
  "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node \"C:/dev/claude-agent-monitor/hooks/bridge.mjs\"", "async": true, "timeout": 10 }] }]
}
```

- Nothing changes unless someone is looking at the page: with no visible page, or with the monitor not running,
  the hook answers nothing and the normal VS Code prompt appears right away.
- A request nobody answers goes back to VS Code after 60 seconds.
- Answers need a token the server creates at every start (in the page, and in `.runtime/bridge.json` for the hook).
  Another web page cannot read it, so it cannot approve anything.
- Pending requests live in memory only. The command or file path is shown on the page so you can judge it,
  and is never written to disk or logged.

## Board format

See `boards/example.json`.

- `status` is one of `running | queued | blocked | done`; `order` sets the queue position.
- `roles` maps a session to a short role, e.g. `{ "-0f": "auth · simulation" }`.
- `session` and the keys of `roles` may be a short name (`-0f`), a full session name or a nickname (`Tom`, `민준`).
- `boards/*.json` and `config.json` are local state and are not committed.
